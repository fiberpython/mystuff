Project: Refresh Of My coding skills
Requriements: Any lanuge that fits my fancy.

Thanks for stopping by. Please enjoy my coding style. I'm sure that there 
are much better sites that you can visit to learn how to code something in
stead of right here. I'm looking to display some of my abilities found
in this repo.
