# One of our monitoring tools records how long various operations within
# a request take. A  problem that we have is that sometimes parts are 
# untimed. We'd like the parts which are not  covered by the intervals 
# so that we can fill them in.  Write a program that reads a list of 
# possibly-overlapping intervals from STDIN, 
# one per line, and  outputs a list of the intervals notâ€‹ 
# covered by the input intervals. For example, given input
